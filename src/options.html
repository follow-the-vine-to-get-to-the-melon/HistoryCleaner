      <p>
        Setting the number of days will delete anything older than that amount
        of days. (Setting it to 7 will delete any history older than a week)
      </p>
      <p>
        Setting a number of visits will cause it to delete sites only with that
        amount of visits or less. (Setting it to 5 will delete any URLs from
        your history that you only visited 5 or less times.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have both a number of days and a number of visits set, it will
        delete history older than the number of days AND less than the number of
        visits. (Setting them to 7 and 5 will cause it to delete any is both
        older than a week AND has been visited 5 or less times.)
